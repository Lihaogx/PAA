It is known as a continuing resolution (CR) and prevents a government shutdown that would otherwise occur if the FY2024 appropriations bills have not been enacted when the existing CR expires.The CR provides funding through March 1, 2024, for agencies and programs that were funded in the following four FY2023 appropriations acts: the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2023; the Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2023; the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2023; and the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2023. (Under the current CR, these agencies and programs are funded through January 19, 2024.)For most other federal agencies and programs, the CR provides funding through March 8, 2024. (Under the current CR, these agencies and programs are funded through February 2, 2024.)The CR generally funds most programs and activities at the FY2023 levels with several exceptions that provide funding flexibility and additional appropriations for various programs. For example, the CR includes exceptions for the National Nuclear Security Administration and the Federal Aviation Administration.In addition, the CR allows the Department of Defense to obligate specified funds from the Shipbuilding and Conversion, Navy account for the procurement of one Columbia Class Submarine.The CR also extends the authority for the U.S. Parole Commission.DIVISION B--OTHER MATTERS TITLE I--HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICESSubtitle A--Public Health Extenders(Sec. 101) This section extends through March 8, 2024, funding for the Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical Education Program, the Community Health Center Fund, and the National Health Services Corps.
