            "Summary": "This bill directs the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to establish the FAA Task Force on NOTAM (notice to air missions required by international or domestic law) Improvement and requires the FAA to implement a federal NOTAM system.

It states the abnormal status of a component of the National Airspace System.Specifically, the task force must (1) review existing methods for publishing NOTAMs and flight operations information for pilots; (2) review regulations, policies, systems, and international standards relating to NOTAMs, including their content and presentation to pilots; (3) evaluate and determine best practices to organize, prioritize, and present flight operations information in a manner that optimizes pilot review and retention of relevant information; (4) provide recommendations to improve the publication and delivery of NOTAM information; and (5) report to Congress on its reviews and evaluations.By September 30, 2024, the FAA must (1) complete implementation of a federal NOTAM system and implement a back-up system, and (2) brief Congress on a plan to enhance information delivery through this federal system to promote further global harmonization and provide users of the National Airspace System a consistent format for domestic and international operations.",

This bill instead allows an April 22, 1980, agreement between the United States, Oregon, and the tribe (known as the Siletz Agreement) to define the tribe's rights until and unless it is amended or replaced upon mutual agreement of the tribe and Oregon (with specified limitations regarding a new agreement).The bill allows the tribe and Oregon to return to the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon to request the modification or termination of the May 2, 1980, consent decree."
