The bill also extends several expiring programs and authorities, including several public health programs.DIVISION A--FURTHER ADDITIONAL CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2024Further Additional Continuing Appropriations Act, 2024 (Sec. 101) This section provides continuing FY2024 appropriations for federal agencies. It is known as a continuing resolution (CR) and prevents a government shutdown that would otherwise occur if the FY2024 appropriations bills have not been enacted when the existing CR expires.The CR provides funding through March 1, 2024, for agencies and programs that were funded in the following four FY2023 appropriations acts: the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2023; the Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2023; the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2023; and the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2023. (Under the current CR, these agencies and programs are funded through January 19, 2024.)For most other federal agencies and programs, the CR provides funding through March 8, 2024. (Under the current CR, these agencies and programs are funded through February 2, 2024.)The CR generally funds most programs and activities at the FY2023 levels with several exceptions that provide funding flexibility and additional appropriations for various programs. For example, the CR includes exceptions for the National Nuclear Security Administration and the Federal Aviation Administration.In addition, the CR allows the Department of Defense to obligate specified funds from the Shipbuilding and Conversion, Navy account for the procurement of one Columbia Class Submarine.The CR also extends the authority for the U.S. Parole Commission.DIVISION B--OTHER MATTERS TITLE I--HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICESSubtitle A--Public Health Extenders(Sec. 101) This section extends through March 8, 2024, funding for the Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical Education Program, the Community Health Center Fund, and the National Health Services Corps.

(The Special Diabetes Program for Type I Diabetes supports research on the prevention and cure of Type I diabetes, and the Special Diabetes Program for Indians supports diabetes treatment and prevention for tribal populations.)(Sec. 103) This section extends through March 8, 2024, the authority that allows states and tribes to request the temporary reassignment of state and local health department personnel who are funded through certain federal programs to immediately address a public health emergency.It also extends through March 8, 2024, provisions that prohibit the disclosure of information about Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) programs that could compromise national security (e.g., information regarding biomedical threats).The section extends provisions that authorize HHS to engage with developers of medical countermeasures, and that provide for related antitrust exemptions, for the purpose of furthering product development.Additionally, the section extends through March 8, 2024, the National Advisory Committee on Children and Disasters, the National Advisory Committee on Seniors and Disasters, and the National Advisory Committee on Individuals with Disabilities and Disasters.It also extends through March 8, 2024, the authority of HHS to directly appoint candidates to positions within the National Disaster Medical System if HHS determines the number of personnel in the system is insufficient to address a public health emergency or potential public health emergency.(The National Disaster Medical System is a partnership between HHS, the Department of Defense, and other federal departments that responds to public health and other emergencies, including by deploying medical response teams.)Subtitle B--Medicaid(Sec. 121) This section delays reductions to Medicaid disproportionate-share hospital (DSH) allotments until March 9, 2024.

This program supports projects to implement sexual risk avoidance education that teaches participants to voluntarily refrain from nonmarital sexual activities.(Sec. 143) This section extends funding through March 8, 2024, for the Personal Responsibility Education Program. This program provides grants to states to educate young people about abstinence and contraception for prevention of pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.

            "Summary": "This bill authorizes the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to take certain actions to address emergencies, disasters, and supply chain disruptions (particularly the shortage of infant formula in the United States) affecting participants of the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC).The bill directs USDA to require each infant formula cost containment contract to include remedies in the event of an infant formula recall, including how an infant formula manufacturer would protect against disruption to WIC participants in the state.USDA must, within 30 days, ensure there is a memorandum of understanding with the Department of Health and Human Services that includes procedures for coordination and information sharing regarding any supply chain disruption, including a supplemental food recall.The bill also authorizes USDA to waive or modify any WIC qualified administrative requirement during emergencies, disasters, and supply chain disruptions. Specifically, USDA may waive or modify such a requirement for one or more state agencies if (1) the requirement cannot be met by state agencies during the emergency, disaster, or disruption; and (2) the modification or waiver is necessary to provide assistance to WIC participants and does not substantially weaken the nutritional quality of supplemental foods. For example, USDA may waive the maximum monthly allowance for infant formula.The bill establishes notification requirements for USDA and state agencies related to supply chain disruptions."
