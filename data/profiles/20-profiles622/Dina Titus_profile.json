            "Summary": "This bill authorizes the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to take certain actions to address emergencies, disasters, and supply chain disruptions (particularly the shortage of infant formula in the United States) affecting participants of the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC).The bill directs USDA to require each infant formula cost containment contract to include remedies in the event of an infant formula recall, including how an infant formula manufacturer would protect against disruption to WIC participants in the state.USDA must, within 30 days, ensure there is a memorandum of understanding with the Department of Health and Human Services that includes procedures for coordination and information sharing regarding any supply chain disruption, including a supplemental food recall.The bill also authorizes USDA to waive or modify any WIC qualified administrative requirement during emergencies, disasters, and supply chain disruptions. Specifically, USDA may waive or modify such a requirement for one or more state agencies if (1) the requirement cannot be met by state agencies during the emergency, disaster, or disruption; and (2) the modification or waiver is necessary to provide assistance to WIC participants and does not substantially weaken the nutritional quality of supplemental foods. For example, USDA may waive the maximum monthly allowance for infant formula.The bill establishes notification requirements for USDA and state agencies related to supply chain disruptions."

            "Summary": "This bill sends a strong message that people who commit war crimes are not welcome here and should be punished, regardless of where their offense was committed or who they victimized.”What opponents sayGovTrack Insider was unable to locate any explicit statements of opposition. However, some may criticize it for being a feel-good but toothless measure, as the U.S. has never actually prosecuted a single person for war crimes even under the existing authorities.Some prominent adjacent examples weren’t technically prosecutions for war crimes, even if they were sometimes erroneously reported that way in the media. William Calley’s 1970’s trial for perpetrating the Vietnam War’s My Lai massacre was for premeditated murder, not war crimes. Same for retired SEAL Eddie Gallagher, convicted for posing with a photograph of an Islamic State captive’s corpse, before his demotion was reversed by then-President Donald Trump.Odds of passageIn addition to its Democratic lead sponsor, the House version has attracted one Republican cosponsor: Rep. Victoria Spartz (R-IN5). It awaits a potential vote in the House Judiciary Committee.The Senate version has attracted three bipartisan cosponsors: two Democrats and one Republican. It awaits a potential vote in the Senate Judiciary Committee.  Last updated Jun 3, 2022.View all GovTrack summaries.The summary below was written by the Congressional Research Service, which is a nonpartisan division of the Library of Congress, and was published on Feb 9, 2023.Justice for Victims of War Crimes ActThis bill broadens the scope of individuals who are subject to federal prosecution for war crime offenses.Currently, the federal war crimes statute provides federal jurisdiction over war crime offenses committed anywhere (i.e., inside or outside the United States) if the victim or offender is a member of the Armed Forces or a U.S. national.First, this bill extends federal jurisdiction over war crime offenses committed anywhere to offenses where (1) the victim or offender is an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence; or (2) the offender is present in the United States, regardless of the nationality of the victim or the offender.Second, the bill expands federal jurisdiction over war crime offenses to include offenses that occur in whole or in part within the United States, regardless of whether the victim or offender is a member of the Armed Forces, a U.S. national, or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence."
