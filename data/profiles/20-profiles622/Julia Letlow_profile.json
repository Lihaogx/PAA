This section also eliminates a requirement that the applicant faces an ongoing serious threat in Afghanistan due to such employment.Furthermore, for an applicant qualifying for a visa by performing duties for U.S. military personnel stationed with a NATO mission, this section eliminates a requirement that the duties performed qualify as sensitive and trusted duties.This section also relaxes limits to appealing rejections for applications for such visas.(Sec. 402) This bill authorizes the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to jointly postpone the medical exam requirement for individuals seeking entry into the United States under the program described in Section 401.If an individual receives such a postponement, DHS shall ensure to the greatest extent possible that individual undergoes a medical exam no later than 30 days after admission into the United States.

Further, if such an employee is separated from service before they are entitled to receive an annuity, they may receive a refund of their accelerated contributions.",
