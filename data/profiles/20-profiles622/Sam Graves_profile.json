Specifically, if an individual submitted an application to the Chief of Mission that included an accompanying spouse or child and that application would have been approved but for the individual's death, the surviving spouse or child shall remain eligible to receive a visa under the respective program. Currently, such survivor rights only apply if the deceased individual's petition was approved.(Sec. 404) If an individual has an approved petition under a program that provided special immigrant status to translators who worked for the Armed Forces in Afghanistan or Iraq but a visa is not immediately available, the State Department or DHS may convert that petition to an approved petition under another program which provides special immigrant status to certain Iraqi nationals, if there are visas available under that second program.
